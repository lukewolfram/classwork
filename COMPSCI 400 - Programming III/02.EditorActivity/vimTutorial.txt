=            VIM Activity for CS400 @ UW Madison (Fall 2022)                =
=                    - based on v1.7 of the VimTutor -                        =
===============================================================================

     This activity is designed to walk you through some of the commands
     you will need to use Vim as an editor for the activities in this
     class and for editing Java code.
     The activity is split up into 4 parts. You can directly edit this file
     for each of the parts.

     Before you start, make sure that your Caps-Lock key is NOT active and press
     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that part 1.1
     completely fills the screen.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Part 1.1:  MOVING THE CURSOR


   ** To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. **
	     ^
	     k		    Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
       < h	 l >		   The l key is at the right and moves right.
	     j			   The j key looks like a down arrow.
	     v
  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.

  2. Hold down the down key (j) until the screen scrolls down.
     Now you know how to move to the next part.

  3. Using the down key, move to part 1.2.

NOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <ESC> to place
      you in Normal mode. Then retype the command you wanted.

NOTE: The cursor keys also work for moving around. Often, Vim users prefer
      the hjkl because they make moving the cursor faster once you get used
      to them. For this class you can use the ones you prefer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    Part 1.2: EXITING VIM


  NOTE: Before executing any of the steps below, read this entire part.

  1. Press the <ESC> key (to make sure you are in Normal mode).

  2. Type:	:q! <ENTER>.
     This exits the editor, DISCARDING any changes you have made.

  3. Get back here by executing the command that got you into this tutor. For
     the CS400 activity this is: vim vimTutorial.txt <ENTER>

  4. If you have these steps memorized and are confident, execute steps
     1 through 3 to exit and re-enter the editor.

NOTE:  :q! <ENTER>  discards any changes you made. You will learn how to save
       changes to a file later in this tutorial.

  5. Move the cursor down to part 1.3.

  4. As each error is fixed press <ESC> to return to Normal mode.
     Repeat steps 2 through 4 to correct the sentence.

		       Part 4: THE HELP SYSTEM

  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, type:
	:help <ENTER>

  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.
  Be careful when using the combination CTRL-W. On some systems, your browser
  will interpret this as a command to close your window (and will close the
  window with your VM). A way around this is the small keyboard symbol on the
  top right of your VM window. Click on it and select CTRL-W as a key
  combination to Vim running in the VM without closing your browser window.
  Type    :q <ENTER>    to close the help window.

  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
  ":help" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):

	:help dd
	:help y
